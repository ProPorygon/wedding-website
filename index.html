            <h2>Meeting in Pittsburgh</h2>
            <p>
                Julie and Kevin met in Pittsburgh. Julie had just come from Taiwan to study Mechanical Engineering
                at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy, while Kevin had just started a new job at an AI startup in the city.
                As Julie was busy with her studies, the two began cooking together as a way to share time efficiently.
                Their most memorable date was getting hot chocolate and ice skating at the holiday downtown light up night.
